<p>The console screen, also known as the command-line interface (CLI), is a text-based interface used to interact with a computer system through typed commands.
     It's essential for executing various tasks, running scripts, and performing system operations. 
     To open the console screen on Windows, press Win + R, type cmd, and hit Enter. On macOS, open Spotlight (Cmd + Space), type Terminal, and press Enter.
     To print anything on the console, use the print or console.log() command in programming languages like Python or JavaScript, respectively. For example, in Python, use print("Hello, World!") to display "Hello, World!" on the console.
